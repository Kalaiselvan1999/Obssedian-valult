## Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python

### Understanding the GIL

- The GIL is a mechanism that ensures only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time.
- This prevents race conditions and simplifies memory management.

### Implications of the GIL

- **Single-threaded execution:** The GIL limits Python to single-threaded operations within a process.
- **Performance impact:** For CPU-bound tasks, the GIL can introduce overhead.
- **Multiprocessing for CPU-intensive tasks:** To overcome the GIL's limitations, use the `multiprocessing` module for parallel execution across multiple processes.

### Workarounds and Alternatives

- **Multiprocessing:** Create separate Python processes for parallel execution.
- **Asynchronous programming:** Use libraries like `asyncio` or `aiohttp` for non-blocking I/O operations.
- **Cython:** Compile Python code to C extensions for performance gains.

### How two threads perform both CPU and `I/O` operations during execution -

**01.** The python interpreter creates a process and spawns the threads.  
**02.** When Thread 1 starts execution, it'll acquire the GIL and lock it.  
**03.** Thread 2 has to wait for GIL to be released by Thread 1.  
**04.** In case if Thread 1 is waiting for IO from the client, it releases the GIL and Thread 2 will acquire it and start the execution.  
**05.** Now suppose If Thread 1 gets the IO, Then Thread 1 has to wait for GIL to be release by Thread 2.
