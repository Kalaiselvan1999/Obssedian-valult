The phrase "includes connections to upstream servers" is an important concept in the context of [[Nginx]] and web server configurations. Let's break this down to understand it better:

### What are upstream servers?

Upstream servers, in the context of Nginx, refer to the backend servers that Nginx communicates with to fetch or process content before sending it back to the client. These are typically:

- Application servers (e.g., Django, Flask, Rails)
- Other web servers (e.g., Apache)
- Database servers
- Caching servers (e.g., Memcached, Redis)

### Connection flow

1. Client makes a request to Nginx
2. Nginx establishes a connection to the appropriate upstream server
3. Upstream server processes the request and sends a response back to Nginx
4. Nginx forwards the response to the client

### Why this matters for connections

When we say "includes connections to upstream servers", it means:

1. Each client request typically requires at least two connections:
   - One between the client and Nginx
   - Another between Nginx and the upstream server (e.g., your Django application)

2. The `worker_connections` setting in Nginx doesn't just limit client connections, but the total number of connections a worker can handle, including those to upstream servers.

### Impact on capacity

This has several implications:

1. **Reduced client capacity**: If each client request requires two connections, your effective capacity for client connections is roughly halved.

2. **Resource management**: Nginx needs to manage both incoming and outgoing connections, which affects memory and CPU usage.

3. **Potential bottlenecks**: If connections to upstream servers are slow or numerous, it can reduce the number of client connections Nginx can handle simultaneously.

### Example scenario

Let's say you have:
- `worker_connections 768;`
- Nginx acting as a reverse proxy for a Django application

In this case:
- Theoretical max connections: 768
- Practical max client connections: ~384 (768 / 2)

This is because each client connection typically requires one connection to the client and one to the Django server.

### Best practices

1. **Optimize upstream connections**: Ensure your Django application responds quickly to reduce the time connections are held open.

2. **Use connection pooling**: This can help reduce the number of new connections needed to upstream servers.

3. **Monitor both client and upstream connections**: This gives you a complete picture of your server's connection usage.

4. **Consider increasing `worker_connections`**: If you're hitting limits, you might need to increase this value, but also ensure your system can handle the increased load.

Understanding that "connections" includes those to upstream servers helps you more accurately estimate your server's capacity and optimize its performance.
