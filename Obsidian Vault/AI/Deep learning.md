Deep learning is a subset of [[machine learning]] that uses multilayered [[neural networks]], called deep neural networks, to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain. Some form of deep learning powers most of the [[artificial intelligence (AI)]]Â applications in our lives today.

- **Neural Network Structure:** Deep learning models use multiple layers (often hundreds or thousands), while traditional machine learning models typically use one or two.
- **Data Requirements:** Deep learning models can learn from raw, unstructured data using unsupervised learning, while supervised learning models require structured, labeled data.
- **Output Refinement:** Deep learning models can self-evaluate and refine their outputs for improved accuracy.
- **Automation:** Deep learning powers applications that perform tasks without human intervention.
- **Analytical and Physical Tasks:** Examples include digital assistants, voice-enabled TV remotes, credit card fraud detection, self-driving cars, and generative AI.
# How DL works

## What is Deep Learning?

### Neural Networks

- Neural networks mimic the human brain with inputs, weights, and biases.
- These elements work together to recognize, classify, and describe objects.

### Deep Neural Networks

- Multiple layers of interconnected nodes refine predictions.
- Forward propagation is the process of computations through the network.
- Visible layers are the input and output layers.

### Training Process

- Backpropagation uses algorithms to calculate errors and adjust weights and biases.
- Forward propagation and backpropagation enable accurate predictions.

### Computing Requirements

- Deep learning requires significant computing power.
- GPUs and distributed cloud computing are ideal for handling large calculations.
- Managing multiple GPUs can be costly and resource-intensive.

### Software Requirements

- Most deep learning apps are coded with JAX, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.

# Types of deep learning models

Deep learning algorithms are incredibly complex, and there are different types of neural networks to address specific problems or datasets. Here are six. Each has its own advantages and they are presented here roughly in the order of their development, with each successive model adjusting to overcome a weakness in a previous model

- [[CNN]] - computer vision and image classification
- [[RNN]] - natural language and speech recognition applications
- [[Autoencoders and variational autoencoders]] - generate image and speeh
- [[GANs]] - create new data resembling the original training data
- [[Diffusion model]] - progressive noise-addition and denoising
- [[Transformer models]] - encoder-decoder architecture with a text-processing mechanism
