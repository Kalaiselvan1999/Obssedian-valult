### Four Ways to Win at AI in Finance

1. **Own the workflow and add AI or AI agents:** Integrate AI into existing workflows to enhance customer experience and efficiency (e.g., Stripe, Ramp, Klarna).
2. **Use AI agents to displace legacy systems:** Develop AI-powered solutions to replace outdated systems and gain market share (e.g., compliance automation).
3. **Add co-pilots to existing systems:** Integrate AI as a complementary tool within existing systems to improve performance (e.g., Salesforce, Microsoft, Oracle).
4. **Innovate for incumbents and partner:** Develop AI-based solutions for larger financial institutions and collaborate with them to drive growth (e.g., FIS, Fiserv, banks).

what is AI agent?

**Conceptually: The idea of an AI agent is software with _the agency_ to make decisions, where humans can review but don't have to approve before an action is taken.**

|## **Fintech is ideally placed to win at AI.**|
|Financial services have ridden every macro tech wave.|
|1. Most financial services now use the **default cloud and mobile**.<br>2. Most middle and back office tasks are **increasingly on SaaS providers**.<br>3. **AI tooling is moving faster and becoming affordable**.<br>4. **Financial services are built on unstructured data**, legacy systems, and complex contracts.<br>5. **Finance relies on human judgment**. Headcount is often the highest cost (just look at how much sponsor banks have had to hire in compliance)<br>6. **Humans can only work at human speed**. AI can work at machine speed.<br>7. **AI that can problem-solve like a human is a breakthrough**. AI can now solve the kind of human judgment problems financial services are filled with today.|


## 1. Owning the workflow of growth companies is the best position to add or benefit from AI and Agents.

**Stripe owns the payment and billing workflow** and is naturally placed to use it behind the scenes (although they're being somewhat coy about the direct uses).

Another example is Ramp, whose CEO, Eric, has been on every VC and tech podcast lately, discussing how they use AI internally and for customers. Ramp is using **AI as a product** when it adds features like AI to understand what a user is trying to do and help them navigate to the right screen.
**Ramp owns the spend management, CFO, and finance workflows**. It's winning at the growth customer segment. Its AI story keeps it there, and it can buildÂ **AI as a product**.

**Klarna directly owns the shopping and checkout workflow.**

## 2: Innovation on Top of Incumbents with Agents

### Key Points:

- **AI-as-Agents:** Agents can automate manual tasks in areas like loan origination, compliance, and customer communication.
- **Benefits for Incumbents:** Agents can help incumbents modernize their legacy systems and improve efficiency.
- **Early-Stage Companies:** Agents can also be valuable for early-stage companies that lack the resources to handle manual work.
- **Product Positioning:** By focusing on agents, companies can make their products more understandable and relevant to potential buyers.
- **Examples:** Companies like Casca*, Greenlight, and Parcha are developing AI-as-agent solutions for various industries.
- **Future Outlook:** The future is uncertain for companies that rely on AI-as-agents. It remains to be seen whether they can become the dominant players in their respective markets or if they will be displaced by other technologies.
